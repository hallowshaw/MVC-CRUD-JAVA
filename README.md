## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations in a web application using the MVC design pattern. MVC helps to separate concerns in the application, making it easier to manage and maintain. The combination of JSP and Servlets provides a powerful and flexible environment for developing dynamic web applications.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new records to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display existing records from the database.
- **Update:** Modify and update existing records in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlets
- MySQL
- HTML/CSS

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard MVC structure:

- **Model:** Contains Java classes that represent the data and business logic.
- **View:** Consists of JSP files responsible for rendering the user interface.
- **Controller:** Servlets act as controllers, handling user requests, processing data, and managing the flow.

```
|-- src
|   |-- main
|       |-- java
|           |-- com.example
|               |-- model
|                   |-- // Java classes representing data models
|               |-- servlet
|                   |-- // Servlets handling requests and managing flow
|-- webapp
|   |-- WEB-INF
|       |-- views
|           |-- // JSP files for rendering views
|       |-- web.xml

```
